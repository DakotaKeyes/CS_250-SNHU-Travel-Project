How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Focusing on a user-centered approach to development is essential for quality assurance and producing deliverables that meet all the user's requirements.  
User stories are a great way to gather information and understand the necessary requirements for the project.  Adding value points to the user stories can
help the development team prioritize and estimate project details.  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs first by ensuring I understand all the requirements being asked of me - This is one of the most crucial aspects of 
development. Planning and thoroughly understanding the program requirements to develop what the user/program needs. 
With a clear comprehension of conditions, it will be possible to properly provide deliverables that run correctly and contain all the necessary features and specifications.
